Yesterday, John MacFarlane released a new version of =pandoc=, the universal
document converter.  This means that my Emacs org-mode reader is now available
to everyone.  I'm very curious to see if people actually use the new reader
(and if I have to deal with a lot of bugs and/or feature requests in the near
future).

I can't state enough just how great =pandoc= is as a tool and library.  The
code is very clean, well documented and extending it is (almost ridiculously)
easy.  And as for the usefulness: Hakyll, the software used for this blog, is
heavily building on =pandoc=. 'nough said.

So is =pandoc= really like a virus spreading Haskell, as [[https://github.com/jgm][jgm]] recently
[[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1278#issuecomment-42502343][implicated]]?  All I know is that it most certainly got me infected.  A new
project of mine, [[https://github.com/tarleb/rundoc][=rundoc=]], builds on =pandoc= and is (of course) written in
Haskell.  It looks like I'll do most of my coding in it, for the foreseeable
future.
