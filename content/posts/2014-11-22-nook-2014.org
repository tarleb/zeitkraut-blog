Last night was the night of this year's MetaNook.  It was the fourth time that
the local hackers, most notably [[https://metameute.de][MetaMeute]] and [[https://chaotikum.org][Chaotikum]], joined forces to
organize a night full of beginner-friendly introductions, advanced tech talks,
and project presentations.

# It fills me with quite some proud to see the project, in whose creation I
# was directly involved, continue to prosper.

My [[https://github.com/tarleb/shell-talk][talk contribution]] this year was a brief introduction in the “magic” of the
command-line.  The talk slides are adapted to the topic in that the
presentation must be given from the command line.  Each slide is just a
function, the whole presentation environment is held together by scripts and
other shell-equivalences of duckt-tape.  Feedback from the thirty or-so
attendees was mostly positive.

It was a very fun experience over all, as usual.
